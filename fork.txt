FORK :- 
        A fork is new repository that shares code and visibility settings
        with the original "upstream" repository.

        Fork is a rough copy of a project.

        In other words, let say you have to do some modifications/changes 
        in some other's project or your friend's project or want to contribute 
        in the open-source project. Then, you can fork that project on your 
        GitHub, that means you can create copy of code with exactly same 
        setting and other things totally same on your GitHub, so that you
        can work on it and do modifications as per convenience.

        You can commit in main branch of that forked project copy. This 
        will not change the original code in main branch.
        In order to merge this change in the code of original project,
        you can create a  new pull request
