1. Local repository (repo) => our laptop/computer
   Remote repo => git

2. changes in git language means => commit

3. Configuring Git (means telling Git with which account and username we want to commit changes)
   git config --global user.name "give username"
   git config --global user.email "someone@email.com" (there two ways of configuration: local and global)
   git config --list  (to see details stored in git config)

4. Clone - Cloning a repository on our local machine to work 
   git clone <project link>  (thhis helps to work on local system and push it to remote repo)

5. status - displays the state of the code
   git status

6. There are 4 status of any file in git :-

   untracked -
   new files that git doesn't yet track (new file)

   modified - 
   changed

   staged - 
   file is ready to be committed

   unmodified - 
   unchanged

7. after modify there is two step process :-
   modify -> add -> commit

8. change (modified) / created newfile (untracked)  --> add (staged) --> commit (unchanged)

9. add - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area
   git add <file name> (use 'git restore --staged <file name>' instead of 'add' to unstage)

   commit - it is the record of change
   git commit -m "add some message"

   push - this command upload local repo(laptop) content to remote repo(GitHub)
   git push origin main

10. when git status display 
    "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.", this line means we are 1 commit ahead 
    as compared to GitHub

11. init command
    
    init - used to create a new git repo

    git init  (this command intializes a new Git repository in the current working directory
               this is can be verfied using "ls -h" command, if it is git repo then, this 
               command gives ".git")

    git remote add origin <link> (this command means we are adding new remote(git) repo and 
                                   name it as origin and gives its link )
    git remote -v (to verify remote; i.e. what is that repository)
    git branch (to check currently I am in which branch)
    git branch -M branch (to rename branch)
    git push origin main
